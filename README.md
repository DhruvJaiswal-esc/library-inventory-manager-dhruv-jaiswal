# Library Inventory Manager

Mini project for **Programming for Problem Solving using Python**.

## Overview

A small command-line Library Inventory Manager that allows staff to:

- Add new books to the catalog
- Issue and return books
- Search by title or ISBN
- View the full book list
- Persist the catalog to a JSON file

The project demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, encapsulation)
- File handling with JSON and `pathlib`
- Robust exception handling and logging
- Simple menu-driven CLI
- Basic Python package structure
